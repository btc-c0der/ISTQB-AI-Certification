### 3.2 BDD for AI Systems: Extended Example

```gherkin
Feature: Image Recognition Accuracy

  Background:
    Given the AI system has been trained on the standard image dataset
    And the system is configured for image classification

  Scenario: Correct classification under normal conditions
    When I submit a clear image of a "cat" 
    Then the system should classify it as "cat" with confidence > 90%
    And the classification should complete within 200ms

  Scenario: Robust classification under partial occlusion
    When I submit an image of a "dog" with 30% occlusion
    Then the system should classify it as "dog" with confidence > 75% 
    And no spurious classifications should appear in the top 3 results

  Scenario Outline: Performance across diverse image conditions
    When I submit an image of a "<subject>" with "<condition>"
    Then the system should classify it correctly with confidence > <min_confidence>%
    And the results should be consistent across 3 repeated attempts

    Examples:
      | subject | condition          | min_confidence |
      | cat     | normal lighting    | 90             |
      | cat     | low lighting       | 75             |
      | cat     | high contrast      | 80             |
      | dog     | normal lighting    | 90             |
      | dog     | blurred (2px)      | 70             |
      | dog     | grayscale          | 85             |

### 5.3 BDD Database Test for AI-Specific Requirements

```gherkin
Feature: AI Model Data Versioning

  Background:
    Given the ML feature store is initialized 
    And database version tracking is enabled

  Scenario: Model and data version synchronization
    When model version "v2.1" is deployed to production
    Then the database should serve feature vectors from compatible dataset version "v2.x"
    And any incompatible data access should be prevented
    And a warning should be logged if data and model versions might be incompatible

  Scenario: Feature data lineage tracking
    When a prediction is made for user "12345" using model "sentiment_v3"
    Then the system should record which features were used in the prediction
    And the source and transformations of each feature should be traceable
    And the feature values at prediction time should be retrievable for later analysis

  Scenario: Handling data drift
    Given model "product_rec_v1" is running in production
    When the statistical properties of the input features drift by more than 20%
    Then the database should log a data drift alert
    And automated retraining should be triggered if drift persists for 24 hours
    And model performance metrics should be compared pre and post-drift

   - Baseline model performance on benchmark datasets
   - Deploy shadow models for comparison
   - Implement continuous model performance monitoring

3. **Ethical & Bias Risks**
   - Conduct regular fairness audits
   - Test with diverse and representative data
   - Implement fairness metrics in the CI/CD pipeline

4. **Operational Risks**
   - Implement canary deployments
   - Enable model rollback mechanisms
   - Develop degradation detection and alerting
