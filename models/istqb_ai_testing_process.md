## 8. Key Best Practices for AI Testing

### 8.1 AI Testing Principles

1. **Data-Centric Testing**: Focus on data quality, as it directly impacts AI system quality
2. **Continuous Testing**: Implement testing throughout the AI development lifecycle
3. **Explainability Focus**: Prioritize testing the explainability of AI decisions
4. **Bias Detection**: Actively test for and mitigate biases in AI systems
5. **Performance Boundaries**: Clearly establish and test performance boundaries
6. **Version Control**: Maintain strict version control of models, data, and test cases
7. **Automated Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring for deployed AI systems

### 8.2 BDD-Style AI Test Case Examples

```gherkin
Feature: AI Model Performance Monitoring

  Background:
    Given the AI system is deployed in production
    And baseline performance metrics are established
    And monitoring systems are active

  Scenario: Detecting performance degradation
    When the system processes production data for 7 days
    Then accuracy metrics should remain within 5% of baseline values
    And if any metric drops below threshold, an alert should be triggered
    And the system should log detailed diagnostic information

  Scenario: Data drift detection
    When new data patterns emerge in production
    Then the system should detect data drift within 24 hours
    And a notification should be sent to the ML operations team
    And the system should continue to function with degraded confidence levels

  Scenario Outline: Performance across different user segments
    When analyzing performance for user segment "<segment>"
    Then fairness metrics should be within acceptable thresholds
    And no segment should have accuracy more than 10% below average

    Examples:
      | segment       |
      | new users     |
      | power users   |
      | mobile users  |
      | international |
