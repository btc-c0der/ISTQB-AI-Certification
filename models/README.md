# ISTQB AI Testing Models

This directory contains comprehensive models and frameworks for AI testing based on ISTQB guidelines. These models serve as references for understanding the ISTQB approach to testing AI systems and can be used as study material for the ISTQB AI Testing certification.

## Available Models

### 1. Comprehensive AI Testing Model

**File**: `istqb_ai_comprehensive_model.md`

This model provides a complete overview of AI testing based on ISTQB guidelines, covering:

- AI System Testing Taxonomy
- AI Test Case Design
- AI Testing Methodology
- Risk-Based Testing for AI
- Compliance and Standards
- ISTQB Certification Focus Areas

### 2. AI Testing Process Model

**File**: `istqb_ai_testing_process.md`

This model focuses on the process of testing AI systems, detailing:

- Requirements Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Design & Implementation
- Test Execution
- Test Reporting
- Improvement & Refinement

### 3. AI Database Testing Patterns

**File**: `istqb_ai_database_testing_patterns.md`

This model provides specific patterns for testing databases that support AI systems:

- Data Quality Testing
- Performance Testing
- Reliability Testing
- Security Testing
- Scalability Testing
- ML Feature Store Testing

## How to Use These Models

These models can be used in several ways:

1. **Study Reference**: Use them as comprehensive study materials for the ISTQB AI Testing certification exam.

2. **Implementation Guide**: Apply the patterns and approaches to real-world AI testing projects.

3. **Testing Framework**: Use the models as a foundation to build testing frameworks for AI systems.

4. **Knowledge Base**: Refer to these models when encountering specific testing challenges in AI projects.

## Relationship to BDD Test Suite

These models align with the BDD test suite located in the `tests/` directory. The BDD tests implement many of the patterns described in these models, particularly the database testing patterns.

## Contributing

To extend or improve these models:

1. Follow the established pattern formats
2. Add ASCII diagrams to visualize concepts when appropriate
3. Include concrete examples, preferably in Gherkin syntax
4. Ensure alignment with official ISTQB guidelines
