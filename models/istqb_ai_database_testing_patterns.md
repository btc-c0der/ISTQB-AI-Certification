### 3.2 Data Quality Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: AI Training Data Quality Validation

  Background:
    Given the ML feature store database is initialized
    And data quality rules are defined

  Scenario: Detection of missing values in critical features
    When I query the feature store for dataset "customer_features_v2"
    Then the overall missing value rate should be less than 2%
    And critical features should have a missing value rate of 0%
    And a quality report should be generated with detailed statistics

  Scenario: Feature distribution drift detection
    Given baseline statistical properties for dataset "product_interactions" are recorded
    When new data is ingested into the "product_interactions" dataset
    Then the statistical distributions should be compared with baselines
    And an alert should be triggered if drift exceeds 15% on any feature
    And the drift metrics should be stored for trend analysis

  Scenario Outline: Feature value validation by data type
    When validating feature "<feature_name>" in dataset "<dataset>"
    Then all values should comply with data type "<data_type>"
    And values should fall within the range <min_value> to <max_value>
    And outliers beyond <std_devs> standard deviations should be flagged

    Examples:
      | feature_name | dataset       | data_type | min_value | max_value | std_devs |
      | user_age     | demographics  | integer   | 13        | 120       | 3        |
      | purchase_amt | transactions  | float     | 0.01      | 50000     | 4        |
      | session_time | user_behavior | integer   | 1         | 3600      | 3        |

### 4.2 Performance Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: AI Database Performance Under Load

  Background:
    Given the database is populated with realistic AI training data
    And the monitoring systems are active

  Scenario: Feature vector retrieval performance
    When I simulate 1000 concurrent inference requests
    Then 99% of feature vector retrievals should complete within 50ms
    And the database CPU utilization should remain below 80%
    And no errors should be returned to calling services

  Scenario: Batch processing for model retraining
    When I extract 10 million records for model retraining
    Then the extraction should complete within 10 minutes
    And database performance for other operations should not degrade by more than 20%
    And the extraction process should use efficient pagination

  Scenario Outline: Performance scaling with data volume
    Given the database contains <data_volume> of training examples
    When I run a standard feature extraction query
    Then the query should complete within <expected_time> seconds
    And resource utilization should scale sub-linearly

    Examples:
      | data_volume | expected_time |
      | 1GB         | 2             |
      | 10GB        | 8             |
      | 100GB       | 30            |

+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
```

### 5.2 Reliability Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: AI Database Reliability and Fault Tolerance

  Background:
    Given the database cluster is operational
    And monitoring systems are active

  Scenario: Transaction integrity during node failure
    When a database node fails during model training data extraction
    Then all transactions should either complete fully or roll back
    And data consistency should be maintained
    And automatic failover should occur within 30 seconds
    And no data should be lost

  Scenario: Recovery from corruption in feature store
    Given a simulated corruption in the feature store database
    When the recovery procedure is executed
    Then all features should be restored to their last known good state
    And data integrity checks should pass for all restored data
    And the recovery time should be within the SLA of 4 hours

  Scenario Outline: System behavior under partial failure
    Given the "<component>" is experiencing "<failure_type>"
    When ML feature requests are submitted to the system
    Then requests should be served with fallback mechanisms
    And degraded performance mode should activate automatically
    And alerts should be generated for operations team

    Examples:
      | component      | failure_type        |
      | primary_db     | high_latency        |
      | replica_db     | connection_timeout  |
      | network        | packet_loss         |
      | compute_node   | overloaded          |

+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
```

### 6.2 Security Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: AI Database Security and Privacy

  Background:
    Given the database contains sensitive training data
    And security controls are implemented

  Scenario: Proper access controls for training data
    When I attempt to access the training data as a "<role>" user
    Then access should be "<result>"
    And all access attempts should be logged with user identity
    And failed access attempts should trigger security alerts

    Examples:
      | role                | result  |
      | data_scientist      | granted |
      | ml_engineer         | granted |
      | application_user    | denied  |
      | system_admin        | partial |

  Scenario: Protection of personally identifiable information
    When I query the feature store for customer data
    Then PII fields should be masked by default
    And full PII access should require explicit privileges
    And PII access should be logged for compliance reporting

  Scenario: SQL injection prevention in AI query interfaces
    When I submit feature queries with SQL injection attempts
    Then all operations should fail safely
    And the attempts should be logged as security events
    And no unauthorized data access should occur
```

### 7.2 Scalability Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: AI Database Scalability

  Background:
    Given the database system is configured for scaling
    And baseline performance metrics are established

  Scenario: Horizontal scaling with increasing data volume
    When the training data volume increases from 100GB to 1TB
    Then read query performance should degrade by no more than 20%
    And write operations should maintain a throughput of at least 1000 records per second
    And automatic sharding should distribute data evenly

  Scenario: Feature store performance under high concurrent access
    When 500 concurrent model inference requests access the feature store
    Then 95th percentile response time should remain under 100ms
    And no request failures should occur due to connection limits
    And connection pooling efficiency should exceed 90%

  Scenario Outline: Performance with scaled computation complexity
    Given features require <computation_type> at query time
    When I execute model inference queries at a rate of 100 per second
    Then average response time should be less than <max_response> ms
    And CPU utilization should not exceed <max_cpu> percent

    Examples:
      | computation_type      | max_response | max_cpu |
      | simple_aggregation    | 50           | 40      |
      | window_functions      | 100          | 60      |
      | complex_calculations  | 200          | 80      |

### 8.2 Feature Store Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: ML Feature Store Functionality

  Background:
    Given the feature store is operational
    And feature definitions are registered

  Scenario: Feature versioning and compatibility
    When I register a new version of feature "customer_lifetime_value"
    Then both versions should be available simultaneously
    And models using version 1 should continue to function
    And metadata should clearly identify version differences
    And automated tests should validate backward compatibility

  Scenario: Point-in-time feature retrieval
    When I request features for entity_id "customer_123" as of "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    Then the feature values should reflect the state at exactly that timestamp
    And time-travel queries should complete within 200ms
    And appropriate indexes should be utilized

  Scenario Outline: Feature computation and caching strategies
    Given feature "<feature_name>" has update frequency "<update_frequency>"
    When the feature is requested for online serving
    Then it should be served from the "<expected_source>"
    And retrieval time should be less than <max_time> ms

    Examples:
      | feature_name        | update_frequency | expected_source | max_time |
      | real_time_score     | per_request      | computed        | 100      |
      | daily_aggregation   | daily            | cache           | 20       |
      | static_attribute    | static           | cache           | 10       |
```

### 9.2 Model Lifecycle Test Patterns

```gherkin
Feature: Database Support for AI Model Lifecycle

  Background:
    Given the ML platform database is configured
    And model management systems are operational

  Scenario: Model version tracking and lineage
    When I deploy model version "recommendation_v3.2.1"
    Then the database should record complete model lineage
    And training dataset references should be immutable
    And feature versions used should be documented
    And rollback to previous versions should be possible

  Scenario: A/B testing database support
    When I configure an A/B test between model versions "v3.1" and "v3.2"
    Then the database should correctly route 50% of traffic to each version
    And performance metrics should be recorded separately for each variant
    And statistical significance calculations should be supported
    And segment analysis should be possible on the results

  Scenario Outline: Model monitoring data retention
    Given model "<model_name>" generating predictions
    When monitoring data is collected for <time_period> days
    Then performance metrics should be queryable with <max_query_time> ms latency
    And trend analysis should be possible across the full period
    And storage efficiency should follow retention policies

    Examples:
      | model_name          | time_period | max_query_time |
      | daily_recommender   | 30          | 500            |
      | fraud_detection     | 90          | 1000           |
      | sentiment_analysis  | 180         | 2000           |
```
