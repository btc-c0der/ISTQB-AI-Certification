## Security Testing Framework for AI Systems

The security testing framework follows a multi-layered approach:

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Security Test Patterns

### Pattern 1: Authentication and Authorization Testing

```gherkin
Feature: Authentication and Authorization

  Background:
    Given a system with defined user roles and permissions
    And authentication mechanisms are in place

  Scenario: Access Control Enforcement
    Given I am logged in as a "<role>" user
    When I attempt to access a resource requiring "<required_role>" permissions
    Then the access should be "<result>"
    And the access attempt should be logged

  Examples:
    | role    | required_role | result  |
    | regular | regular       | allowed |
    | regular | admin         | denied  |
    | admin   | admin         | allowed |
    | admin   | regular       | allowed |
```

### Pattern 2: Data Protection Testing

```gherkin
Feature: Data Protection

  Background:
    Given sensitive data is stored in the system
    And data protection mechanisms are in place

  Scenario: Sensitive Data Exposure
    When I query the system for user information
    Then sensitive data should be properly protected
    And raw credentials should never be exposed
    And data transmission should be secure

  Scenario: Data Leakage Prevention
    When I attempt to extract large amounts of data
    Then rate limiting should be enforced
    And suspicious activity should be flagged
```

### Pattern 3: Injection Attack Prevention

```gherkin
Feature: Injection Attack Prevention

  Background:
    Given the system accepts external inputs
    And input validation mechanisms are in place

  Scenario: SQL Injection Prevention
    When I submit inputs with SQL injection attempts
    Then all operations should fail safely
    And no unauthorized data access should occur
    And database integrity should be maintained

  Scenario: Command Injection Prevention
    When I submit inputs with command injection attempts
    Then all operations should fail safely
    And system command execution should be prevented
```

+---------------+       +----------------+       +------------------+
                                                         |
                                                         v
+---------------+       +----------------+       +------------------+
| Reporting &   |<------| Impact         |<------| Post-Exploitation|
| Remediation   |       | Assessment     |       | Analysis         |
+---------------+       +----------------+       +------------------+
```

## Integration with BDD Testing

The Behavior-Driven Development approach allows for:
1. Clear communication with stakeholders
2. Verifiable security requirements
3. Automated security testing
4. Documentation of security behaviors

By using Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then), we create a common language for expressing security requirements that can be understood by technical and non-technical team members while also being executable as automated tests.
